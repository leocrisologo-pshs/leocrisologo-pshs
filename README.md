- 👋 Hi, I’m @leocrisologo-pshs, I am a high school Mathematics teacher in the Philippines.
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching and developing materials for online learning that can be repurposed for blended learning when face to face classes can be done again.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and manim.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing high school mathematics videos with manim.
